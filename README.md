# studyclock

### What is it?

Basically, a stopwatch. Someday i started wanting to measure my study time and thought it was a good idea to code my own tool for it.  
Different from some pomodoro clocks that you can find on the internet, the intention here is to turn on the stopwatch and just do whatever you want and then store and see data about it. Kinda abstract, but it's a good excuse to build an app.

### Stuff used

- Django (monolith)
- Tailwind
- Material icons

### Actual state

Is possible to store and delete sessions, and the time info is showed in Brazil time zone.

### Plans

Implement global timezone soon and make this a SPA. Also these files are a mess.
